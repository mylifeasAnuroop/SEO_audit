### Site Architecture
- **URL Structure**: Ensure that URLs are clean, descriptive, and devoid of unnecessary parameters. Each URL should reflect the page hierarchy.

- **Internal Linking**: With 33 internal links, ensure that they are strategically placed to enhance navigation and the flow of link authority throughout the site. Use internal links to pass authority and relevance between related pages.
